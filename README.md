Our modified DETR transformer encoders extract the features from RGB and IR modality via two parallel ResNet50 backbone and harness the vast potential of heterogeneous data via channel fusion of modalities features (RGB and IR) using two parallel cross-attention encoders unlike the original DETR transformer model.
